                <p>This is a book about instructing computers. Computers are about as common as screwdrivers today, but they are quite a bit more complex, and making them do what you want them to do isn’t always easy.</p>

                        <strong>On programing</strong>
                        <p>Besides explaining JavaScript, I will introduce the basic principles of programming. Programming, it turns out, is hard. The fundamental rules are simple and clear, but programs built on top of these rules tend to become complex enough to introduce their own rules and complexity. You’re building your own maze, in a way, and you might just get lost in it.</p>

                        <strong>Why language matters</strong>
                        <p>In the beginning, at the birth of computing, there were no programming languages. Programs looked something like this:</p>

                <p>Inside the computer’s world, there is only data. You can read data, modify data, create new data—but that which isn’t data cannot be mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of bits and is thus fundamentally alike.</p>

                <header>Program Structure</header>
                <p>In this chapter, we will start to do things that can actually be called programming. We will expand our command of the JavaScript language beyond the nouns and sentence fragments we’ve seen so far, to the point where we can express meaningful prose.</p>

            <header>Functions</header>
            <p>Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming. The concept of wrapping a piece of program in a value has many uses. It gives us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to associate names with subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.</p>

                    <strong>On programing</strong>
                    <p>Besides explaining JavaScript, I will introduce the basic principles of programming. Programming, it turns out, is hard. The fundamental rules are simple and clear, but programs built on top of these rules tend to become complex enough to introduce their own rules and complexity.

                    <strong>Defining a function</strong>
                    <p>A function definition is a regular binding where the value of the binding is a function. For example, this code defines square to refer to a function that produces the square of a given number:
                        <code>const square = function(x){
                            return x * x;
                        }
                        console.log(square(12));
                        // ➡ 144
                        </code>
                    </p>
                
                </li>
            </ul>
            <section class="main section" id="objects_and_arrays">
                <header>Objects and Arrays</header>
                <p>Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the atoms that data structures are built from. Many types of information require more than one atom, though. Objects allow us to group values—including other objects—to build more complex structures.</p>
